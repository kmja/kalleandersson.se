						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>SounDark is a virtual reality game made in Unity. You are a frightened little bird who has to flee the kitchens where evil chefs want to cook you. The twist: you can only see through sound. Speaking into a microphone on the virtual reality headset will emit visible sound waves, illuminating the world around you. But be careful - the chefs have ears, too...</p>
						<p>In our team of 6, we all contributed to the game design and interaction, but my individual contributions were modeling and animating the game characters.</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>I was part of the reception of newly admitted students at Media Technology, my program at KTH. I did some photo and video production, but my main area of responsibility was helping with creating and maintaining the reception website. There, I did graphic design and front-end development, working mostly in HTML/CSS/JS and a bit of PHP.</p>
						<p>My main learnings from this project was about working in large groups over long periods of time (preparing for the reception), as well as working very closely and intensely (during it).</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>Clickipedia is a mobile application I developed as part of a course that stretched over the entire fall of 2016. In the course, we went through the stages of concept creation, identifying customer needs, creating business models, actual development, and iterating with user studies. My result was an educational Wikipedia game targeted toward children of ages 10-16. The objective is to find a specific Wikipedia article through clicking links found in other articles.</p>
						<p>I used Phonegap to develop a hybrid mobile application, which I'd never done before. I also learned about conducting user studies individually and staying motivated throughout a long individual project.</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>This is a Kinect-based game of virtual squash. Players use their bodies to control avatars and bounce a ball against their opponent. If you get the ball past your opponent, you get a point. First to 3 wins.</p>
						<p>I learned a lot from this project. I had never worked with either the Kinect or Unity before, so it was a rough first week, but I came out of it knowing the basics of making a game in Unity. Considering the short timeframe and our lack of experience, I think we did a good job.</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>This was a short individual project in an information visualization course. For every country that had the data, I compared survey data of voting participation with actual participation data from the country's last election. I then color-coded the information on a world map to illustrate the gap in each country's voting numbers.</p>
						<p>I learned the basics of D3 in this project, and I also used SVG graphics interactively for the first time.</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>This is an augmented reality application intended to be used alongside history museum installations. It presents historical information about world explorers in a fun, interactive way by animating their journeys on an augmented reality globe. The idea was to have a huge globe in a museum that visitors could track with their phones to show the animations.</p>
						<p>I did the UI design as well as information content, and I learned a lot about UI creation in Unity. I also got better at Photoshop and Illustrator, needing to adapt the content to the limitations I had with the game engine.</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>This was another short individual project in the information visualization course where I also did "Vote Or Don't" and was part of the group that created "Late". The task here was to visualize the facebook posts of the KTH Visualization Studio where the course was taught. I did so in a simple way by plotting each post's date and lifetime reach as a classic bar chart.</p>
						<p>I wanted to get better at CSS transitions and responsive design, so I chose to put my efforts on making the cleanest and smoothest visualization I could. I think I found a nice design language with this project and you can definitely see its legacy in the design of this portfolio.</p>

						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>The final project in the information visualization course that yielded "Vote Or Don't" and "Facebook Activity", Late is a visualization of delays in the Stockholm commuter train system. We collected train data from a typical weekday and created a timeline where you can see rush hour delays spread through the system, both in an overview of the entire system as well as a detail view of individual stations.</p>
						<p>We had loosely defined roles in our group, but I handled much of the interaction, designing the overview/detail flow and visualization.</p>
